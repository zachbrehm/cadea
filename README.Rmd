This package is the accompanying software for the method described in TBA.

In this method, we perform differential expression analyses for genes under the assumption that tissue composition influences gene expression. This amounts to representing the read count for gene $i$ in sample $j$ as $Y_{ij} = \sum_{k = 1}^K Y_{ijk}$, where $Y_{ijk}$ is the read count of gene $i$ in sample $j$ contributed by celltype $k$. We typically assume that the read count $Y_{ij}$ described above to be a negative binomial, where the mean variance relationship is parametrized as $\sigma_{ij}^2 = \mu_{ij} + \delta_{ij}\mu_{ij}^2$. We similarly assume that $Y_{ijk} \sim NB(\nu_{ijk}, \tau_{ijk})$, implying that $Y_{ij} = \sum_{k = 1}^K Y_{ijk}$ is rather distributed according to the convolution of the cell type distributions. Such distributions have been derived by Edward Furman in his paper \textit{On the convolution of the negative binomial random variables.} 

## Installation

You can install the development version of cadea from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("zachbrehm/cadea")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#  library(cadea)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
